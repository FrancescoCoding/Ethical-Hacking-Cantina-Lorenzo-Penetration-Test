# Ethical Hacking - A penetration test for Cantina Lorenzo
This penetration testing exercise required me to carry out a penetration test of a virtual machine (VM) based on a cellar system to identify at least three significant security risks and propose countermeasures that address them.

A summary of my plan to address this exercise is as following:
- Systematically scan and enumerate the network with a range of tools to determine what systems are alive and reachable.
- Research the versions of the existing services, and determine their History and possible vulnerabilities.
- Find a way to exploit the vulnerabilities, utilising academically respected sources such as CVE and Rapid7.
- Report such vulnerabilities professionally and propose countermeasures for them.

The learning objectives of this exercises were:
- Demonstrate understanding of network protocol vulnerabilities and the security of an IT infrastructure.
- Design and implement countermeasures to protect a network from unauthorised network access.
- Demonstrate an awareness and ability to analyse and perform network security testing procedures on an IT infrastructure to identify vulnerabilities.
